##### What is PonyFest?

Ponyfest is an annual online convention for the My Little Pony (MLP) community. The convention started in 2020 and has since become a well-known event in the MLP community.
One of the key benefits of Ponyfest is that it's entirely online, which means that attendees from all over the world can participate without worrying about travel costs or accommodation, allowing the event to attract a diverse range of attendees from all walks of life.
The organizers of Ponyfest have worked hard to create an inclusive and supportive community. The event is designed to promote support and fun, and attendees are encouraged to participate in activities and engage with one another. The event also features several panels, deep dives, games, and events that cover a range of topics related to MLP.
One of the critical ways that Ponyfest supports its vendors is by providing them with a dedicated marketplace, allowing vendors to showcase their products to a large audience and generate sales. The event also features a charity auction, which raises funds for a selected charity.
One of the unique features of Ponyfest is its collaboration with other conventions. The event has worked with a number of other MLP conventions to create joint programming and promote cross-promotion between events, helping to strengthen the MLP community and promote a sense of unity among fans of the franchise.
Overall, Ponyfest is a convention designed to support and promote the MLP community. The event provides a platform for fans of the franchise to come together, have fun, and engage with one another. The event organizers have worked hard to create an inclusive and supportive environment. They have also provided opportunities for vendors to promote their products and for attendees to support charity causes.

##### Why BlueyFest?

As part of their efforts to expand their reach and promote community-building, the organizers of Ponyfest have decided to venture into the Bluey Community by hosting a one-day event that celebrates the popular Australian animated series.
Bluey is a children's television show that has gained a significant following since its debut in 2018. The show features a family of anthropomorphic dogs, and each episode explores a different aspect of family life. The show has been praised for its positive representation of family dynamics, its focus on play-based learning, and its emphasis on social and emotional development.
The Ponyfest organizers recognized the overlap between the MLP and Bluey communities. Both fandoms are known for their emphasis on family-friendly content and their commitment to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment. By venturing into the Bluey Community, Ponyfest hopes to build bridges between the two fandoms and promote the cross-pollination of ideas and interests.
The one-day event will feature a range of activities inspired by Bluey. Attendees can expect to participate in workshops, panel discussions, and other activities that explore the themes and values of the show. There will also be opportunities for attendees to showcase their own Bluey-inspired creations and to connect with other fans of the series.
By hosting this event, Ponyfest hopes to further its mission of promoting community-building and support in fandom culture. The organizers recognize the plethora of opportunities by bringing together fans of different shows and franchises. They are excited to explore the possibilities that the Bluey Community has to offer.
