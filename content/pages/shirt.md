All money raised from this shirt not used for production, handling and shipping goes directly to Guide Dogs For America: https://www.guidedogsofamerica.org/

Guide Dogs For America is one of the major organizations in the United States specialized in raising, training and connecting guide dogs with people in need. Through their training and placement programmes, based on the Assistance Dogs International standard, Guide Dogs For America provides service dogs for people with visual impairments, for veterans, for autistic youth as well as care facilities. A well raised and trained dog is not only an adorable household member, but an invaluable companion to help people in need - They enable people with vision disabilities to safely navigate their surroundings, they support victims of trauma and mental struggles through their journey, and they generally give people the means to participate in daily life a lot more easily and confidently. From connecting individuals in need with the right dog for their needs to adding an invaluable mental health support staff member to places such as victim advocate centers, hospitals and schools, Guide Dogs For America does its part to bring out the best in both animals and humans alike.

My Little Pony online fan event PonyFest has themed itself all in the name of wonderful dog friend Bluey this time around, hosting BlueyFest, a free online event aimed at all ages! You can join us for a big round of fun over here: https://blueyfest.dog/
